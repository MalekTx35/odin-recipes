                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Extra virgin olive oil</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Vegetables: </strong>1 large chopped onion, 1 to 2 green bell peppers, and 2 minced
                        garlic
                        cloves. These three ingredients (plus spices) creates a sofrito to start the chunky sauce.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Spices: </strong>coriander, cumin, paprika-- a trio of warm North African flavors.
                        If you
                        like spicy shakshuka (some call it eggs in purgatory), add a pinch of red pepper flakes or
                        cayenne
                        pepper.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tomatoes:</strong> In this recipe, I use 6 fresh medium-sized tomatoes and about ½
                        cup of
                        tomato sauce, this combination gives me the texture and flavor I'm looking for.
                        It helps if your fresh tomatoes are soft and almost overripe. If tomatoes are not in season,
                        you can
                        replace them with 1 28-ounce can of whole tomatoes or 6 cups canned chopped tomatoes with
                        their
                        juices.
                        If you use the canned tomato alternative, you can omit the tomato sauce.</li>
                    <li><strong>Eggs: </strong>large raw eggs</li>
                    <li><strong>Garnish: </strong>This is totally optional, but for me a handful of fresh chopped
                        parsley
                        and mint just before serving adds freshness and a pop of color.
                        And if you love your shakshuka with feta, then add a sprinkle of creamy feta cheese just
                        before
                        serving.</li>

            <p>This easy shakshuka recipe is something I make often for Sunday brunch,
                although I'm not shy to serve it for dinner as well.
                There are two main components to this recipe: The chunky tomato sauce and the eggs.</p>
            <p>The sauce starts with a sofrito of chopped onions, green bell peppers, and garlic,
                seasoned with North African flavors including cumin, coriander, paprika and a dash or red pepper
                flakes
                (you can omit the red peppers if you don't eat spicy food).
                Whenever possible, I like using fresh ripe tomatoes when making shakshuka (the softer tomatoes will
                do great here).
                But when tomatoes are not in season, I am okay using a can of whole plum tomatoes or canned diced
                tomatoes.
                Once the sauce is ready, you'll simply nestle the eggs in it and allow them to gently cook in the
                simmering sauce until the whites settle.
                The eggs are meant to be runny, but if you don't like them that way, it's fine to cook them to your
                liking.</p>

                <h3>How to Make Shakshuka</h3>
                <p>The print friendly recipe with measurements is just below, but here is a quick tutorial with a few
                    photos
                    to help you along. This recipe basically has two main steps:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Make the shakshuka tomato sauce: </strong>Start by sauteing chopped onions, bell
                        peppers,
                        and garlic with a little bit of extra virgin olive oil in a large, heavy skillet or pan (with a
                        lid). Season with kosher salt and coriander, paprika, cumin, and crushed pepper flakes. Cook for
                        at
                        least 5 minutes, stirring, until the veggies are tender, then add fresh diced tomatoes (I used 6
                        vine ripe tomatoes) and ½ cup of tomato sauce. (Or, if you don't have fresh tomatoes, you can
                        use
                        canned a large 28-ounce of canned whole tomatoes or 6 cups of canned diced tomatoes). Bring the
                        tomatoes to a boil, then cover and let simmer for about 15 minutes, then uncover and cook a few
                        more
                        minutes until your sauce has thickened.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add the eggs and cook: </strong>When the sauce is ready, use the back of a spoon and
                        make
                        some holes in the sauce. Crack your eggs and nestle each egg in one of the holes you created.
                        Cover
                        the skillet and allow the eggs to simmer in the sauce over medium-low heat until the egg whites
                        have
                        settled (as I said earlier, the eggs are supposed to be soft and somewhat runny. If you like
                        your
                        eggs hard, you can let them cook a bit longer)</li>
                    <li><strong>Serve immediately!: </strong>Once the eggs are ready, garnish with parsley and serve
                        immediately!</li>
                </ul>
                <h3><strong>What to serve with Shakshuka?</strong></h3>
            <p>There is no right or wrong way to serve this tasty dish, but in my opinion, bread such as pita or
                a
                crusty loaf (or even challah) is essential. (I've been known to even use up extra garlic bread
                to dunk
                in the chunky tomato sauce). You can serve shakshuka with other dishes</p>
