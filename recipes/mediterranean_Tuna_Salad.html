                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <p>This Mediterranean tuna salad combines quick and easy canned tuna with Mediterranean flavors: cool
                    cucumber, briny caper, salty feta and tangy Dijon mustard.
                    It's pretty straightforward in its composition, but it's a genius idea for using simple ingredients
                    to make big flavors.
                    We made it once, and it's now on repeat for a simple lunch or dinner. Here's what you'll need:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Canned tuna:</strong> Use either water-packed or oil packed (we prefer water packed)
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Shallot:</strong> A milder version of red onion, it's a favorite for salads</li>
                    <li><strong>Red bell pepper</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>English cucumber: </strong> This variety is long and thin with no tough skin, no seeds
                        and a milder
                        flavor than standard cucumber: look for it in the produce section!</li>
                    <li><strong>Capers:</strong> These bring big salty, briny flavor: look for them jarred near the
                        pickles in your grocery</li>
                    <li><strong>White wine vinegar</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Olive oil</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Dijon mustard</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Kosher salt</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Feta cheese crumbles</strong></li>
                </ul>
